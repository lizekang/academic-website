Configuration tuning is vital to optimize the performance of cloud database management system. We use Deep Reinforcement Learning to find the optimal configurations in high-dimensional continuous space. Now our system is significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art tuning tools and DBA experts. And our paper was accepted by SIGMOD2019.
